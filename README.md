ByteAndBite
is a Python script designed to track the real-time availability status of your favorite restaurants on the Wolt platform. 
By providing the Wolt web address of a restaurant's page, the script converts it into an API URL and continuously polls the Wolt API to determine if the venue is currently open for delivery. 
The script displays dynamic updates on the venue's status, notifying users when it's time to indulge in their favorite dishes or patiently wait for the next meal opportunity. 
Ideal for those who want to stay informed about the operational status of their preferred eateries without constantly refreshing the Wolt app.
